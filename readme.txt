== Description ==

BuddyPress is designed to extend WordPress and bring along a whole host of new social features. BuddyPress
will let users register on your site and start creating profiles, posting messages, making connections,
creating and interacting in groups and much more. If you're looking to use WordPress to build a niche community
or communication tool then BuddyPress will enable that with a click of a button.

Finally, you will need to activate a BuddyPress compatible theme. Two BuddyPress themes are bundled with the plugin,
you can activate these using the "Appearance > Themes" menu in your WordPress admin area. To install other BuddyPress
compatible themes, use the "Appearance > Add New Themes" menu and select the "buddypress" checkbox before hitting the
"Find Themes" button.
