Deprecated BuddyPress Themes
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In BuddyPress versions prior to 1.1, BuddyPress shipped with two default themes
that would be activated together.

This is no longer the case as BuddyPress has moved to a single theme parent/child
setup.

If you are still using these themes you should follow the instructions for converting
to use the new default theme. It should be quite simple to copy over your style changes.

You can find instructions for updating to the new theme setup on the codex:

The deprecated two theme setup will continue to work for BuddyPress version 1.1 and 1.2, after
which it will be removed.
